    <p style="margin-left: 35px;"> Oliver uses nature as a springboard to the sacred - the beating heart of her work. </p>

    <p> "Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1416572457/?tag=thneyo0f-20"> The Anthologist </a>," crawls in the margins of Oliver's "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0807068772/?tag=thneyo0f-20"> New and Selected Poems, Volume One </a>." A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because ha has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale - before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple, And yet each has something." </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 35px;">
        I don't know exactly what a prayer is. <br>
        I do know to pay attention, how to fall down <br>
        into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass, <br>
        how to the idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields, <br>
        which is what I have been doing all day.
    </p>
    <p> The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion, she urges elsewhere. </p>
